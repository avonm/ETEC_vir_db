# ETEC_vir_db
ETEC virulence factor database

This is a database containing ETEC virulence factors, including putative novel and variants of known colonization factors.

There are different formats of the database:
1) Nucleotide sequence of each gene (includes all the genes in the CF operons/gene clusters). Headers are organised according to ABRicate
(add reference hear)
2) Protein sequence of each gene that is formated so it can be used for annotating genomes with prokka. Use the --proteins option.


This is a growing database of virulence genes in ETEC. I will also create a separate database with putative virulence factors.
