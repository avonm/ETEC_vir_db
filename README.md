# ETEC_vir_db
ETEC virulence factor database

This is a database containing ETEC virulence factors, including putative novel and variants of known colonization factors.

There are different formats of the database:
1) Nucleotide sequence of each gene (includes all the genes in the CF operons/gene clusters). Headers are organised according to ABRicate
(add reference hear)
2) Protein sequence of each gene
3) 


If there are additional genes that you would find valuable to add please contact me and I'd be happy to look into it.
